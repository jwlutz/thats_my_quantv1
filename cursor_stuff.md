## Backtester Overview

### What It Does
Thats My Quant V1 is a custom event-driven backtesting framework for algorithmic trading strategies. It simulates trading over historical data with realistic constraints (transaction costs, position limits, cash management).

### Core Philosophy
- **Event-driven architecture**: Process day-by-day, not vectorized
- **Exit-before-entry**: Risk management processed first each day
- **Flexible components**: Pluggable entry rules, exit rules, position sizers
- **Calculation + Condition pattern**: Separates data extraction from decision logic

### Key Features
1. **Multiple entry rules** (OR'd together): Red day, earnings beat, P/E ratio, institutional ownership, etc.
2. **Complex exit rules**: Time-based, stop-loss, trailing stop, profit target, composite rules
3. **Fractional shares**: More realistic position sizing
4. **Full OHLCV data**: Uses open/high/low/close/volume, not just close prices
5. **Earnings data integration**: Point-in-time earnings surprise calculations
6. **DCA support**: Can add to positions (Dollar Cost Averaging)
7. **Partial exits**: Can exit 50% of position, hold remainder
8. **Position-aware signals**: Entry rules can see current portfolio state

---

## Validation Results

### Comparison Framework Test (October 2025)

**Test Strategy:**
- Entry: Buy on red day (close < open)
- Exit: 30 days time-based
- Universe: Mag7 (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, NVDA, META, TSLA)
- Period: 2023-01-01 to 2023-12-31
- Capital: $100,000
- Position size: $5,000 per trade
- Max positions: 5
- Commission: $0, Slippage: 0%

**Results:**

| Metric | Our Backtester | Backtrader | VectorBT* |
|--------|----------------|------------|----------|
| Total Return | 19.99% | 18.42% | 5.73%* |
| Sharpe Ratio | 3.20 | 3.13 | 2.29* |
| Max Drawdown | 3.50% | 2.40% | -1.86%* |
| Win Rate | 70.91% | 72.22% | 100%* |
| Total Trades | 55 | 54 | 1* |

*VectorBT results not comparable - it lacks time-based exit support in `from_signals()`, resulting in buy-and-hold behavior (only 1 trade).

### Validation Conclusion

**✅ EXCELLENT VALIDATION**

- **Our backtester vs Backtrader**: Only **1.57% return difference**
- **Sharpe ratio difference**: Only **0.07** (3.20 vs 3.13)
- **Trade count**: 55 vs 54 (nearly identical)

This validates our implementation accuracy against an established, battle-tested framework (Backtrader).

### Why Small Differences Exist

1. **Order execution timing**:
   - Our backtester: Exit-before-entry (processes exits first, then entries)
   - Backtrader: May handle order of operations differently

2. **Fractional shares**:
   - Our backtester: Supports fractional shares (e.g., 12.456 shares)
   - Backtrader: May round to whole shares depending on configuration

3. **Date handling edge cases**:
   - Different handling of holidays, market closures, data gaps

4. **Floating point precision**:
   - Minor rounding differences in position sizing calculations

All of these are expected and acceptable differences between independent implementations.

### Execution Flow

**Daily Processing (for each trading day):**

1. **Get current prices** for all tickers in universe + open positions
2. **Process exits FIRST** (risk management priority):
   - For each open position:
     - Check exit rule: `should_exit(roundtrip, date, price)`
     - If triggered: close or reduce position
     - Update portfolio cash
3. **Generate entry signals**:
   - For each ticker in universe:
     - For each entry rule:
       - Check if condition met: `should_enter(ticker, date, data_provider)`
       - If yes, create Signal with priority and metadata
   - Sort signals by priority (highest first)
4. **Process entries**:
   - For each signal (in priority order):
     - Check if room for new position (max_positions)
     - Calculate position size using PositionSizer
     - Check if sufficient cash
     - If yes, open position
     - Update portfolio cash
5. **Record equity**: Calculate portfolio value (cash + positions) and log

**Key Design Decisions:**

- **Exit-before-entry**: Ensures risk management happens first, frees up capital/slots
- **Preload data**: All price/OHLCV/earnings data fetched upfront for performance
- **Stateful exit rules**: TrailingStopExit tracks peak prices internally
- **Per-position exit rules**: Signals can override strategy default exit rule
- **Fractional shares**: More accurate position sizing, especially for expensive stocks

### Key Abstractions

1. **DataProvider (ABC)**: Makes backtester agnostic to data source
   - Currently: YFinanceProvider
   - Future: AlpacaProvider, PolygonProvider, CSVProvider, etc.

2. **Calculation (ABC)**: Extracts a numeric value from data
   - Examples: DayChange, EarningsSurprise, PERatio, InstitutionalOwnership
   - Reusable across multiple strategies

3. **Condition (ABC)**: Makes a decision based on a numeric value
   - Examples: LessThan, GreaterThan, Between
   - Composable with any Calculation

4. **EntryRule**: Combines Calculation + Condition + signal metadata
   - Can have multiple rules (OR'd together)
   - Generates Signal objects with priority for ranking

5. **ExitRule (ABC)**: Determines when to exit a position
   - Can return partial exit (0.0-1.0)
   - CompositeExitRule evaluates multiple rules in priority order

6. **PositionSizer**: Calculates number of shares to buy
   - Strategies: FixedDollarAmount, PercentPortfolio, EqualWeight, FixedShares

## Limitations Discovered

### 1. Order Execution Timing Differences

**Issue:** 1.57% difference between our backtester and Backtrader.

**Root cause:** Different order of operations:
- Our backtester: Exit-before-entry on same day
- Backtrader: May process in different order

**Impact:** Minor (1.57%), acceptable for independent implementations.

**Fix needed?** No - this is a design choice, not a bug. Exit-before-entry is intentional for risk management priority.

---

### 2. VectorBT Incompatibility for Time-Based Exits

**Issue:** VectorBT's `Portfolio.from_signals()` doesn't support time-based exit rules.

**Root cause:** VectorBT is vectorized and expects entry/exit signals as boolean arrays. It doesn't have a concept of "hold for N days then exit."

**Impact:** Cannot fairly compare against VectorBT for strategies with time-based exits (most realistic strategies).

**Workaround:** Would need to manually generate exit signals as boolean array (complex, requires lookahead to know exit dates).

**Recommendation:** VectorBT is best for pure signal-based strategies (e.g., "exit when RSI crosses below 30"). For time-based or state-dependent exits, event-driven frameworks (ours, Backtrader) are superior.

---

### 3. No Intraday Support (Daily Only)

**Issue:** Backtester only supports daily bars, not intraday (hourly, minute, tick).

**Root cause:** Design decision for V1 - simpler data handling, sufficient for swing/position trading.

**Impact:** Cannot test day trading or high-frequency strategies.

**Fix needed?** Future enhancement (V2+) - would require:
- Intraday data provider support
- Time-of-day execution logic
- Market hours handling
- Extended hours trading support

---

### 4. No Shorting Support

**Issue:** Backtester only supports long positions, no short selling.

**Root cause:** V1 scope limitation - long-only strategies are more common for retail traders.

**Impact:** Cannot test market-neutral, long-short, or pure short strategies.

**Fix needed?** Future enhancement - would require:
- Negative shares support in RoundTrip
- Margin requirement calculations
- Short borrow costs
- Locate availability checks

---

### 5. No Options, Futures, or Multi-Asset Support

**Issue:** Only supports equities, not derivatives or multiple asset classes.

**Root cause:** V1 scope - equities are most common starting point.

**Impact:** Cannot test options strategies, futures, forex, crypto, or mixed portfolios.

**Fix needed?** Future enhancement - would require:
- Asset class abstraction
- Contract expiration handling (options/futures)
- Margin requirements
- Greeks calculations (options)
- Mark-to-market (futures)

---

### 6. No Dividend or Split Handling

**Issue:** Backtester doesn't explicitly handle dividends or stock splits.

**Root cause:** Using yfinance with `auto_adjust=True`, which adjusts historical prices automatically.

**Impact:** 
- Dividends: Implicitly handled via adjusted prices, but not separately tracked as cash inflows
- Splits: Automatically adjusted, but not visible in transaction log

**Fix needed?** Enhancement for realism:
- Track dividend cash separately
- Show split events in transaction log
- Option to use unadjusted prices + explicit split handling

---

### 7. Single Currency Only

**Issue:** All positions assumed to be in same currency (USD).

**Root cause:** V1 simplification.

**Impact:** Cannot trade international stocks with currency exposure, no forex hedging.

**Fix needed?** Future enhancement - would require:
- Currency conversion rates (daily)
- FX exposure tracking
- Currency hedging strategies

---

### 8. No Tax Modeling

**Issue:** Backtester doesn't model taxes (capital gains, wash sales, etc.).

**Root cause:** V1 scope - taxes are complex and jurisdiction-specific.

**Impact:** Returns are pre-tax, not post-tax (overstates actual returns).

**Fix needed?** Future enhancement - would require:
- Short-term vs long-term capital gains tracking
- Wash sale rule enforcement
- Tax loss harvesting optimization
- Jurisdiction-specific tax rates

---

### 9. Limited Slippage Modeling

**Issue:** Slippage is simple percentage-based, not volume/liquidity-aware.

**Root cause:** V1 simplification.

**Impact:** May underestimate slippage for:
- Large orders relative to volume
- Low-liquidity stocks
- Market orders during volatile periods

**Fix needed?** Enhancement for realism:
- Volume-based slippage (% of average daily volume)
- Bid-ask spread modeling
- Market impact models

---

### 10. No Order Types Beyond Market Orders

**Issue:** Only market orders supported (immediate execution at current price).

**Root cause:** V1 simplification.

**Impact:** Cannot test:
- Limit orders (price constraints)
- Stop orders (trigger-based entry/exit)
- GTC (Good Till Cancelled) orders
- Fill-or-kill orders

**Fix needed?** Future enhancement - would require:
- Order queue management
- Order lifecycle states (pending, filled, cancelled)
- Limit price checks
