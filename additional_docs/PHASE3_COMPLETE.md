- **Overall Progress**: 60% Complete

## What Was Built

### 1. ExitRule Base Class
Abstract interface for all exit rules:
```python
def should_exit(self, roundtrip, date, price) -> Tuple[bool, float, str]:
    """Returns: (should_exit, exit_portion, reason)"""
```

### 2. Four Concrete Exit Rules

**TimeBasedExit** - Exit after holding N days
- Simple time-based exit
- Tests: threshold triggers, before/after threshold

**StopLossExit** - Exit if loss exceeds threshold
- Risk management
- Tests: exact threshold, above/below threshold, no trigger on profit

**TrailingStopExit** - Exit if price drops X% from peak
- **Stateful tracking** - tracks peak price per position
- Protects gains as price rises
- Tests: peak updates, drawdown triggers, multiple positions

**ProfitTargetExit** - Exit when profit target hit
- **Supports partial exits** - exit_portion 0.0-1.0
- Take profits at targets
- Tests: exact threshold, partial exits (50%, 75%), full exits

### 3. CompositeExitRule
**Priority-based exit evaluation**:
- Evaluates multiple rules in order
- First rule that triggers wins
- Allows complex strategies:
  - Stop loss (checked first for safety)
  - Profit target (take profits)
  - Time exit (fallback)

---

## Test Coverage

**57 comprehensive tests organized by category:**

### TimeBasedExit (8 tests)
- Exit at exact threshold
- No exit before threshold
- Exit after threshold
- Validation (zero/negative days)
- Serialization round-trip

### StopLossExit (8 tests)
- Exit at exact stop loss (-8%)
- No exit within tolerance
- No exit on profit
- Exit below threshold
- Validation
- Serialization

### TrailingStopExit (8 tests)
- Exit at drawdown from peak
- Peak updates correctly
- No exit within trailing stop
- Initial peak = entry price
- **Multiple positions tracked independently**
- Validation
- Serialization

### ProfitTargetExit (12 tests)
- Exit at exact target
- No exit below target
- Exit above target
- No exit on loss
- **Partial exits** (50%, 75%)
- Validation (zero target, invalid portions)
- Serialization with defaults

### CompositeExitRule (10 tests)
- First rule wins (priority ordering)
- Second rule evaluated if first doesn't trigger
- No exit if no rules trigger
- Custom exit portions
- Three-rule priority
- Empty list validation
- **Nested composite rules**
- Serialization

### Factory Function (7 tests)
- Create all rule types
- Unknown type handling
- Missing type handling

### Real-World Scenarios (4 tests)
- Typical stop loss (10% drop â†’ 8% stop triggers)
- Take profit (25% gain â†’ 20% target triggers, exit half)
- Trailing stop protects gains (150 â†’ 135 triggers 10% stop, locks in 35% gain)
- Composite safety-first strategy (stop loss prioritized over profit target over time exit)

---

## Key Features

### 1. Stateful Tracking
```python
rule = TrailingStopExit(trailing_pct=0.10)
# Tracks peak price per position in _peak_prices dict
# Updates peak as price rises
# Triggers when drawdown from peak exceeds 10%
```

### 2. Partial Exits
```python
rule = ProfitTargetExit(target_pct=0.20, exit_portion=0.5)
# At 20% profit, exit half position (keep half running)
# exit_portion can be any value from 0.0 to 1.0
```

### 3. Priority Ordering
```python
composite = CompositeExitRule(
    rules=[
        (StopLossExit(0.08), 1.0),          # Checked first (safety)
        (ProfitTargetExit(0.20), 0.5),      # Then profit target
        (TimeBasedExit(30), 1.0)            # Finally time exit
    ]
)
# First matching rule wins and returns its reason
```

### 4. Full Serialization
All rules support `to_dict()` / `from_dict()` for YAML config:
```python
data = rule.to_dict()
# {'type': 'StopLossExit', 'params': {'stop_pct': 0.08}}

rule = create_exit_rule(data)
# Recreates StopLossExit(0.08)
```

---

## Usage Examples

### Simple Stop Loss
```python
rule = StopLossExit(stop_pct=0.08)
should_exit, portion, reason = rule.should_exit(roundtrip, date, price)
# If price drops 8%: (True, 1.0, "stop_loss")
```

### Trailing Stop (Lock in Gains)
```python
rule = TrailingStopExit(trailing_pct=0.10)
# Entry: $100
# Price rises to $150 (new peak)
# Price drops to $135 (10% from peak)
# Returns: (True, 1.0, "trailing_stop")
# Result: Locked in 35% gain instead of riding it down
```

### Take Profit (Partial Exit)
```python
rule = ProfitTargetExit(target_pct=0.20, exit_portion=0.5)
# At 20% profit, exit half, let rest run
# Returns: (True, 0.5, "profit_target")
```

### Composite Strategy
```python
# Safety-first approach
composite = CompositeExitRule(
    rules=[
        (StopLossExit(0.08), 1.0),          # Cut losses at 8%
        (ProfitTargetExit(0.20), 0.5),      # Take half at 20% gain
        (TimeBasedExit(30), 1.0)            # Exit after 30 days
    ]
)

# Scenario 1: Down 10% â†’ stop loss triggers (first rule)
# Scenario 2: Up 25% â†’ profit target triggers (second rule), exit half
# Scenario 3: Flat after 35 days â†’ time exit triggers (third rule)
```

## Integration with Portfolio

Exit rules work seamlessly with Portfolio class:
```python
# In backtester main loop:
for rt_id, roundtrip in portfolio.open_roundtrips.items():
    price = current_prices[roundtrip.ticker]

    # Check exit rule
    should_exit, exit_portion, reason = roundtrip.exit_rule.should_exit(
        roundtrip, current_date, price
    )

    if should_exit:
        if exit_portion >= 1.0:
            # Full exit
            portfolio.close_position(rt_id, current_date, price, reason)
        else:
            # Partial exit
            shares_to_exit = roundtrip.remaining_shares * exit_portion
            portfolio.reduce_position(rt_id, current_date, price,
                                     shares_to_exit, reason)
```

## What's Next: Phase 4

**Phase 4: Backtester Engine & Results (40% of remaining work)**

### Components to Build:
1. **PositionSizer** - Calculate number of shares to buy
   - equal_weight, fixed_dollar, percent_portfolio, fixed_shares methods

2. **Strategy** - Bundle entry rule + exit rule + universe
   - generate_signals() method
   - YAML serialization

3. **Backtester** - Main simulation engine
   - Daily loop: check exits â†’ generate signals â†’ open positions
   - Equity curve tracking
   - Transaction logging

4. **Results** - Performance analysis
   - Metrics: total return, Sharpe ratio, max drawdown, win rate
   - Visualizations: equity curve, drawdown chart
   - Export functions: transaction log, monthly returns

### Estimated Time: 8-10 hours
- PositionSizer: 1 hour
- Strategy: 2 hours
- Backtester: 3-4 hours
- Results: 3-4 hours
- Tests: Included above

### When Complete:
- **Full working backtester**
- Can run strategies from entry to exit
- Performance metrics and visualizations
- Ready for Phase 5 (YAML config & polish)

## Congratulations!

**You're 60% done with the backtester!** ðŸŽ‰

The hard parts are complete:
- âœ… Position management (DCA, partial exits, cost tracking)
- âœ… Data integration (11 data methods, caching, retries)
- âœ… Entry rules (composable Calculation + Condition)
- âœ… Exit rules (stateful tracking, partial exits, priority ordering)

**What remains:**
- Tying it all together in the Backtester engine
- Computing performance metrics
- YAML configuration
- Final polish

**You're on track to have a production-ready, generalized backtesting framework!**
